		<div>SpiritThe spirit is the energy or life force that lives within all of us. When we die, it is our spirit body that leaves this earth, not our physical body. Our spirit body is so powerful and can never be destroyed.
The primary purpose of the spirit body is to grow and evolve. While it can’t be destroyed, it can be morphed, shifted and changed.

		<div>Mind</div>
		<div>Balance Your Mind Body & Spirit
</div>
		<div>BodyThe body is the vessel in which we move through the world. Every body is unique and every body has its own definition and place of balance. When the body is in balance it becomes easier to express your soul, clear your mind and fulfil your purpose. When out of balance however, it can lead to physical symptoms and weakened immunity.
</div>
		<div>Body</div>
		<div>Spirit</div>
		<div>The mind is a very powerful tool and when out of balance it can lead to worry, anxiety, fear and withdrawal. When in balance however, our mind can help stimulate creativity, make decisions, enhance our intuition and provide the drive and motivation to get things done.</div>

Reading her reviews and working with aQieve made this possible for me.

This is not another place where the trainers dont care and you simply become just another number, they work super hard and make all the efforts to get you to where you need to go.

Those extra reps, that extra push, that voice infront of you….
